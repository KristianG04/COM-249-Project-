# COM-249-Project-
This project entailed pretending that we students were a collective company and how we would conduct operations. My group and I decided to become a Pc gaming development company called Menacing Max Wynn. Within the file, you may find specific investments for hardware, CPUs, etc. We ultimately had to provide a return on investment with the investments made into our company. The coding section provided entailed that any  user/employee could enter the number of hours they worked, salary, etc., forming a project management system. Within the scope of all the classes, you can see how each class implements user input techniques based on what an actual project management system may look like.
