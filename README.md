# COM-249-Project-
This project entailed pretending that we students were a collective company and how we would conduct operations. My group and I decided to become a Pc gaming development company called Menacing Max Wynn. Within the file, you may find specific investments for hardware, CPUs, etc. We ultimately had to provide a return on investment with the investments made into our company. The coding section provided entailed that any  user/employee could enter the number of hours they worked, salary, etc., forming a project management system.
